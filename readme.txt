Quick Math Ball


Project Description
This project is called Quick Math Ball. In this project a ball will start off at ground level and jump upward higher and higher by jumping on logs. The logs have math questions on them that are randomly generated and if the correct answer is entered then the ball will jump onto the corresponding log. If a new log is not jumped onto before the current log falls off the screen then the game is over. There is also a practice mode of the game where the player can press the “spacebar” to pause the game at any time and click on a log to find out the steps to reaching the answer.
